You did a great work, but this design is not meet our needs.
    1，I've combined renting and buying into one seamless experience where the user taps on buy at the top of the screen to change views.
Finally, we still need those functional button shown on the homepage, including map search, rent-tenant, rent-landlord, buy, sell. So in this case, the things can be changed only focus on layout, font, icon, color and image/illustration.
Our reason to keep those:
The rent-tenant button, is a functional button. When user click on it, it jumps to the process that user fill out the form to get an accurate list matching result coming from the matching system, which is different from users' exploration. So this button cannot be removed.
The rent-landlord button is a post button, just like posting a new topic in a forum. It seems you removed this button as well.
The buy and sell button, are functional button as well. It lets user to launch an instant request to the agents currently online, and get response in no more than 1 minutes. Whatever buying or selling a house, they are same at the beginning. That is, launch a request -> get response -> pick an agent -> start the conversation. The only difference between Buy and Sell is the entrance start with a specific form to distinguish whether Buy or Sell.
There is a sample page I send to you last time, and it shows the element have to be kept. (image001)
    2，By breaking up the rentals in different sections like: popular, highest rated, latest, etc.. it encourages more exploration from the user vs. a list where if the user doesn't know what they're looking for, a list can be a little dry.
You are right here, but same as term one I mentioned, it will make us lose most main functions. And I'm afraid, the rest of main functions will be hard to find by the user side.
    3，The location icon on the search represents that the app is allowed to track the users navigation, this automatically refreshes the screen with what's in the users locale. Otherwise they can use the search bar.
We like this location icon idea and that's awesome :)
    4，Let me know what you think of the tab bar. The listing icon is to represent people packing up to let someone else move in.
We agree with this listing icon design.
For all 5 icon in the navigation bar, we thought the thickness of these line icon could be thinner.  And it seems the current icons maybe too thick to fit our themes.
    5，I've moved pay out of the tab bar, because it should be in the flow of when you're purchasing a rental, so it's more in context.
We still need to keep 5 elements in the navigation bar. 
The mid Pay+ button, is the multiple function button, which is not only referring to the payment but also add on some advertisements, coupon, activities as well as news in the near future.
