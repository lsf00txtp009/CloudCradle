Our app is built for people looking for rent, buy and sell houses in North America. We are headquartered in Vancouver, BC Canada.

Attached here is the redesigning details of our project with PDF files which illustrates the very details we need to change.

I'd like to know your pricing and how long it takes. And our deadline is February 15th.

Our app is built for people looking for rent, buy and sell houses in North America. We are headquartered in Vancouver, BC Canada.

Attached here is the redesigning details of our project with PDF files which illustrates the very details we need to change.

I just cc to your another email you leave to me as well.
- If possible, could you please give a quick designing of mobile homepage as it shows in attachment, so that we can see your understanding and designing style. You can use your creativity as much as you want, and do not limited by the layout, color, font, icon and image/illustration it shows to you. 
- Here are some additional explanation:
  - The rent-tenant button, is a functional button. When user click on it, it jumps to the process that user fill out the form to get an accurate list matching result coming from the matching system, which is different from users' exploration. 
  - The rent-landlord button is a post button, just like posting a new topic in a forum.
  - The buy and sell button, are functional button as well. It lets user to launch an instant request to the agents currently online, and get response in no more than 1 minutes. Whatever buying or selling a house, they are same at the beginning. That is, launch a request -> get response -> pick an agent -> start the conversation. The only difference between Buy and Sell is the entrance start with a specific form to distinguish whether Buy or Sell.
  - The mid Pay+ button, is the multiple function button, which is not only referring to the payment but also add on some advertisements, coupon, activities as well as news in the near future. So we need to keep 5 elements in the navigation bar.
- If you have other similar work to show your designing styles, please give us the link as well.
- And I'd like to know your pricing and how long it takes for the whole redesigning. And our deadline is February 15th.  

If you need some more information, please let me know.

Thanks,
